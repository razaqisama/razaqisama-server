# Portfolio Blog Server

Razaqisama - Portfolio Server. A Node.js application built to manage and serve content for my personal portfolio blog. This server is designed to provide a robust backend foundation for creating, retrieving, and managing blog posts that showcase my skills, projects, and insights.

## Features

- **Express Framework:** This server is powered by Express, a fast and minimalistic web framework for Node.js. It handles routing, middleware, and HTTP requests, making it easy to build APIs and web applications.

- **MongoDB Integration:** MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is integrated to efficiently store and manage your blog post data. The Mongoose library is used for modeling and interacting with the MongoDB database.

- **TypeScript:** The entire server is written in TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. This enhances code quality, catch errors early, and provides better development experiences.
